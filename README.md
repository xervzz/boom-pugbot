# G5 Bot
A Discord bot to manage CS:GO PUGs. Connects to [G5API](https://github.com/PhlexPlexico/G5API).
This is a modified version of [csgo-league-bot](https://github.com/csgo-league/csgo-league-bot)

* [Public Bot](https://top.gg/bot/816798869421031435)


## Setup
1. First you must have a bot instance to run this script on. Follow Discord's tutorial [here](https://discord.onl/2019/03/21/how-to-set-up-a-bot-application/) on how to set one up.

   * The required permissions is `1360292944`.
   * Enable the "server members intent" for your bot, as shown [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intents.html#privileged-intents).

2. Install libpq-dev (Linux only?). This is needed to install the psycopg2 Python package.

    * Linux command is `sudo apt-get install libpq-dev`.

3. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in the repository's root directory to get the necessary libraries.

4. Install PostgreSQL 9.5 or higher.

    * Linux command is `sudo apt-get install postgresql`.
    * Windows users can download [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows).

5. Run the psql tool with `sudo -u postgres psql` and create a database by running the following commands:

    ```sql
    CREATE ROLE "g5" WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
    CREATE DATABASE "g5" OWNER g5;
    ```

    Be sure to replace `'yourpassword'` with your own desired password.

    Quit psql with `\q`

6. Create an environment file named `.env` with in the repository's root directory. Fill this template with the requisite information you've gathered...

    ```py
    DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN= # Bot token from the Discord developer portal
    DISCORD_BOT_LANGUAGE=en # Bot language (key from translations.json)
    DISCORD_BOT_PREFIXES=q! Q! # Bot commands prefixes
    EMOJIS_GUILD_ID= # ID of a discord server to create maps emojis

    WEB_PANEL=https://g5v.example.com # G5V url (see https://github.com/PhlexPlexico/G5V)
    API_URL=https://g5v.example.com/api # G5API url (see https://github.com/PhlexPlexico/G5API)

    GAMEMODE_COMPETITIVE=1
    GAMEMODE_WINGMAN=2
    GET5_COMPRTITIVE_CFG=live.cfg # match config file in cfg/get5/ for competitive mode
    GET5_WINGMAN_CFG=live_wingman.cfg # match config file in cfg/get5/ for wingman mode

    POSTGRESQL_USER=g5 # PostgreSQL user name
    POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD= # PostgreSQL password
    POSTGRESQL_DB=g5 # PostgreSQL Database
    POSTGRESQL_HOST=localhost # PostgreSQL host
    ```

7. Apply the database migrations by running `python3 migrate.py up`.

8. Run the launcher Python script by running, `python3 launcher.py`.
